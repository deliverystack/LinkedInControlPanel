# LinkedInControlPanel

This is a just a code repository for two projects:

- https://deliverystack.net/2025/11/26/linkedin-control-panel/
- https://deliverystack.net/2025/11/26/format-text-in-linkedin-comments/

Issues with the solution:

- Special characters can cause weird post URLs, which appear to be auto-generated from the first line of text.

Issues with v3:

- Header is visible and too wide when printing

Not all characters get formatted
Use formatting without loading comments
Feature to open post as primary url

Checkbox next to size slider

Test keyboard shortcyts

- Width adjustment doesn't seem to work on instant messaging page
