The LinkedIn Control Panel exposes a control panel for use within LinkedIn pages using desktop browsers, specifically google's chrome browser.

// TODO: create bookmarklet
// TODO: invoke console script

## Features

- Remove header and sidebars (profile from the left, features on the right)
- Control text width
- Switch to Most Recent view (required to load all comments)
- Load all comments
- Load prior and additional comments
- Remove profile images from comments
- Remove posted images from comments
- Expand comments
- Indicate number of comments loaded
- Pause/resume
- Bold/italic selected text (when submitting a comment)
- Remove CSS break-all anywhere.
- Translate comments from non-primary language

- Format text



- **Hide Sidebars and Header** – Remove the sidebars from the left (your profile) and right (features). This makes better use of screen space and reduces printing length by allowing elimination of vertical columns that are mainly whitespace.
- **Page Width**: Specify width of text relative to browser window, allowing reduction of wasted whitespace.
- **Remove Profile Images**: Loading pages with thousands of comments consumes significant memory. Removing user profile images reduces memory consumption as well as printing length.
- **Remove Images from Comments**: Similar to profile images, images in comments consume memory. If such images are not necessary, for example when using an AI to analyze text comments, remove them.
- **Load Prior and Additional Comments**: LinkedIn loads only one page of comments, in each thread. This option causes it to load the previous and subsequent comments in such threads.
-- **Expand More Links**: LinkedIn hides text in long comments. This option causes full text to appear for each comment.
-- **Order by Most Recent**: LinkedIn defaults to "Most relevant" view, which makes it impossible to load all comments. This option allows the page to load all of the comments.
-- **Show Translation**: Convert comments in other languages to the user's preferred language.

## Convert Between Script and Bookmarklet

To convert a script to a bookmarklet, add the opening and closeing lines around the script:

```
javascript:(function() {
    // script here
})();
```

To convert a bookmarklet to a script that you can run in the browser's developer tools, remove those same lines from the bookmarklet.

The following sections provide access to older versions with fewer features.

## Third Attempt

// TODO:

- [linkedin-control.js](linkedin-control.js)

## Second Attempt

I can't remember exactly what this version generated by ChatGPT does. It may select *Most recent* view, activate any *Load more comments* links until all comments have loaded, activate any *See previous replies* and/or *More replies* links until none appear, activate any *...more* links until none appear, hide the sidebars, increase the text width, include *print now* and/or *pause* buttons, and show a running count of clicks or comments loaded.

## First Draft

Stolen directly from https://www.adsmiths.co.uk/linkedin/how-instantly-expand-all-more-buttons-linkedin,this version of the bookmarklet simply loads all comments.
